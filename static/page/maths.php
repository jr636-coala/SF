	There are six units that I have been studying in maths, these are:
	<ul>
		<li>
			Core 1
		</li>
		<li>
			Core 2
		</li>
		<li>
			Statistics 1
		</li>
		<li>
			Core 3
		</li>
		<li>
			Core 4
		</li>
		<li>
			Decisions
		</li>
	</ul>
	I have already taken the exams for the first three getting 96% overall. Core 3 and Core 4 just carry on from the earlier units expanding on previous topics, Decisions is however much different being closer to computing than maths as it is all about algorithms.
