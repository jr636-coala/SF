<div class="w3-panel w3-card-4">For A-Level computing I need to create a design brief then solution from an issue that needs rectifying.<br/>For my project I chose to do an educational game as a way to get students on the new curriculum, which is more computing based, more enthusiastic about the theory work as it may be boring to them, and would likely not be taught as well due to all classes needing to be taught so there are not enough compuing specific teachers available.<br/>The game consists of a randomly generated maze that the player moves through to get towards the end, some spots in the maze will have questions on, and if the player gets too many wrong they lose.
